# Run 16Bits Locally

To Run 16Bits

1. Install [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/) And [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

2. Get MongoDB Connection URL.
    
    * Go To [MongoDB Atlas Cloud Registration Page](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register) And Get An Account There.

        ### <u> Making A Cluster </u>

    * You can create a cluster which is absolutely free, no credit cards needed. But if you want higher storage and performance, you're free to get a paid one. (Not recommended if you're using the bot in just one server)

    * Select Your cloud Provider & Region. Make sure you choose a region closest to you

    * Cluster Tier - The Default will be set to the free tier, you can change this if you're willing to pay.

    * Now for the cluster name, you can use any name you want.

    * Now hit Create Cluster, It May take a couple of minutes so let it do its job.

        ### <u> Getting The Connection URL </u>

    * The most important thing and the thing you need for this installation, is the MongoDB database connection URL.

    * Now on the left sidebar you'll see some options, click `Database Access`

    * Click on add a new Database user

    * Choose the Authentication Method as Password. Now Add a Username and a password (Make Sure You Remember Both)

    * You Can set the Database User Privileges to either `Atlas Admin` or `Read and Write data to any database`.

    *  Now on the left sidebar you'll see some options, click `Network access`

    * Click on Add IP Address

    * For the IP Address, You will have to choose Allow Access from Anywhere so that your bot can access the database.

    * Now come back to Clusters and click on the Connect button .

    * Now you're at the Choose a Connection Method window, Choose the third option which is the Connect using MongoDB Compass.

    * Now copy the connection string, it will look something like this - ```mongodb+srv://testing:<password>@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/test```

    * Now You'll need to replace `<username>` with your database user username and `<password>` with your database user password.

    * You're all good! Now paste the URL in the `config.json` file which is shown below
